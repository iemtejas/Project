**ChatBot README**

### Introduction
Welcome to the simple If-Else ChatBot! This project is a basic implementation of a chatbot built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes simple if-else conditions to respond to user inputs.

### Requirements
To run this chatbot locally, you need the following:

1. Web Browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Text Editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

### How to Run
Follow these steps to run the chatbot on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iemtejas/Project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

    ```
    cd Project
    ```

3. **Open the HTML file**: Once you're in the directory, locate the `index.html` file and open it in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" and choosing your browser.

4. **Start Chatting**: Once the HTML file is open in your browser, you should see the chatbot interface. Start chatting by typing in the input box and pressing Enter.

### Usage
The chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined if-else conditions. The responses are limited to the conditions set in the JavaScript file. You can customize these conditions and responses according to your requirements by modifying the `script.js` file.
